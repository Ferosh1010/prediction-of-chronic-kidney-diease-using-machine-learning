# prediction-of-chronic-kidney-diease-using-machine-learning 
##Abstraction 
  Chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, describes the
gradual loss of kidney function. Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids
from your blood, which are then excreted in your urine. When chronic kidney
disease reaches an advanced stage, dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and
wastes can build up in your body. . 
##EXISTING SYSTEM 
    Existing have used neural network for Colombian Population
dataset.The result was obtained by training a neuronal network with 5 layers:
an input layer with 7,492 neurons, corresponding to the variables or
characteristics of the model, 3 hidden layers with 500, 100 and 50 neurons
respectively, and an output layer with a single neuron representing the class of
the binary classification problem.
The model achieves 95% accuracy in the test data set, making its application
for disease prognosis feasible.
